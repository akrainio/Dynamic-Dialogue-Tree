	"...*keyboard clacking*...",
	"I see, it looks like your plan was automatically upgraded last month to a premium account. This is the cause of the price hike, and the premium service you are currently receiving.",
	"Okay, got it. I'd like to downgrade back to regular service please.",
	"I'm afraid that's not possible #formal#. That plan was eliminated last month. All regular plans have been promoted.",
	"Hmm, okay. And you said I'm receiving premium service now? I haven't noticed any changes at all.",
	"Yes, that's correct #formal#, you now receive premium service.",
	"Okay, that's all well and good, #name#. But I want my old price back.",
