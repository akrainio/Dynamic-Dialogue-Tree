Dialogue system that simulates an interview with a suspect.

Picking a dialogue option changes the 'mood' of the suspect.
The suspect's 'mood' determines his response.
Responses may contain new information.
New information unlocks new dialogue options.

Thus, picking the same dialogue options but in a different order may result in a different outcome.
